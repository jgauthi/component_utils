# Component Utilities
My PHP functions and several utility methods of different types combined with the [nette/utils](https://doc.nette.org/en/utils) library. Some methods have been [archived](https://github.com/jgauthi/component_utils/tree/v2.1) and are no longer used since the usage of nette/utils.

## Prerequisite

* PHP 5.6+ (v1) or 7.4 (v2)

## Install
Edit your [composer.json](https://getcomposer.org) (launch `composer update` after edit):
```json
{
  "repositories": [
    { "type": "git", "url": "git@github.com:jgauthi/component_utils.git" }
  ],
  "require": {
    "jgauthi/component_utils": "2.*"
  }
}
```


## Documentation
You can look at [folder example](example).
